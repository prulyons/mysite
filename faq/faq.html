		<h2>Why Is My Method A Better Option Instead
Of Traditional Methods? </h2>                 
<p>
To understand why my messages differ to the more traditional methods we first need to understand how Lymphatics work. The Lymphatics system is built of, lymph vessel, lymph nodes and lymph- the fluid that travels through the body. Manual Lymph Massage helps to move the fluid by gently pumping it back into the lymph vessels. Reducing the swelling can reduce discomfort. Without Lymph Massage (MLD) the inflammation can evolve into fibrosis (a permanent hardening of the tissue) or a seroma (pocket of serum).

Lymphatic drainage massage is not a traditional massage, it is a specialised body work modality that uses a gentle, rotating, pumping motion that moves the lymph fluid without increasing the blood circulation. Lymphatic drainage focuses on the skin tissue as the inventory system is directly underneath the skin        
</p>
<p>Compared to traditional massage, the pressure applied with manual lymph drainage is much lower in intensity. The goal of these techniques is to manipulate the lymphatic structures located in the subcutaneous tissues. In order to achieve the desired effect, the pressure in the working phase should be sufficient enough to stretch the subcutaneous tissues against the fascia ( a structure separating the skin from the muscle layer ) located underneath, but not to manipulate the underlying tissue. The amount applied stroking a newborn's head.

In the resting phase of the stroke the pressure is released, which supports the absorption of lymph fluid into lymph vessels. To achieve the maximum effect with each technique, the working phase with every stroke should last about 1 second and should be repeated  five to seven times.

The overall goal of MLD in the treatment of lymphoedema is to re-route the flow of stagnated lymphatic fluid around blocked areas into more centrally located healthy lymphatic vessels, which eventually drain into the nervous system.

<h2>Why do I need lymph drainage therapy after liposuction or other cosmetic surgery procedure?</h2>
<p>
You may notice a hardness or lumpiness to the areas treated with liposuction especially in the abdominal area and even more so if combined with other body contouring procedures. This is normal right after your procedure. This post surgical Lymphedema is caused by inflammation and trauma from the cannula ( instrument that sucks out the fat) moving under the skin. Channels are formed by the cannula that can fill up with fluid and tissue also becomes swollen.
Manual lymph massage helps to move the fluid by gently pumping it back into the lymph vessels. Reducing swelling can reduce discomfort. Without lymph massage (MLD) the inflammation can evolve into fibrosis ( a permanent hardening or the tissue ) or seroma ( pocket of serum) can form.
Many doctors prescribe Lymph Drainage Massage after liposuction to make sure their patients get the best possible results from their procedure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How often is MLD applied?</h2>
<p>
Depending on your surgeons preference, it is recommended that sessions be:
First one 24hrs post  procedure for liposuction, then every other day, if possible. The second week every other day, reducing frequency after that, it is not possible to get to much MLD and the sessions can be scheduled at your convenience.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Is Lymph Drainage Therapy a deep massage ?</h2>
<p>
No although it may seem that deep massage would assist in decreasing the hardness following liposuction, it would actually increase the circulation to the treated areas making it harder to evacuate the lymph fluid. 
Even though MLD is extremely light work , it is the most efficient way to reduce swelling and bruising. It is based on scientific knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system.</p>
<hr>
<h2>
Does MLD help get rid of bruising? </h2>
<p>
Yes, this is one of the best applications of MLD. 
Bruises are accumulation of cellular debris and old red blood cells in the tissue . Lymph Drainage Therapy greatly reduces healing time for bruises by cleansing the space  where the substances are trapped.</p>
<hr>
<h2>
Is Lymphatic Drainage Massage Painful?</h2>
<p>
If performed properly MLD is not painful. Lymphatic drainage is not a traditional massage, it is a specialised bodywork modality that uses a gentle, rotating, pumping motion that moves the lymph fluid without increasing the blood circulation. Increasing the blood circulation with deep massage and heat can actually inhibit the movement of lymph fluid by changing the permeability of the lymph and blood vessel.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How many treatments will I need ?</h2>
<p>
It is ideal to receive at least 1-6 treatments post operatively and that is enough, especially if  itâ€™s the only area.
Patients who get liposuction to the abdomen often find that they require up to 12 sections. Occasionally a client may need more than 12. 
Patients who have multiple procedures at the same time may need sessions.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>How soon after my procedure can MLD begin?</h2>
<p>
It is possible to begin within 24 hours. Most people wait until they are comfortable to drive themselves to appointments. </p>
<hr>
<h2>
Is it too late to begin MLD a month after my procedure?</h2>
<p>
 No , the the healing process after these types of surgical procedures can take up to  a few months, so if it has been over a month since your surgery you can still  get the smoothing BENEFITS of MLD, however if its over 6months since your procedure  and you still feel lumps or hardness you should contact your doctor to make sure you do not develop fibrosis or seroma.</p>
