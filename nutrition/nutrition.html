		<h1>Making The Right Choices</h1>
		<h3>Nutrition and Weight Loss</h3>
		<p>Healthy living is all about making the right choices and to make the right choices about nutrition we need to have the knowledge about the foods we are eating. As a matter of fact many people are starting to realise the importance of maintaining a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. As an MLD therapist I see clients that have undergone weight loss surgery, they spend lots of money trying to achieve the “ perfect body ”.I am passionate about the patient achieving good results and long term benefits from their chosen surgical procedure - therefore I feel that nutrition and MLD underpin surgery to enhance patient‘s health and healthy  lifestyle. With this healthy lifestyle, patients can look and feel good.   I often question my clients about  how they are going to maintain a health diet following their  weight loss surgery, sadly some of them don’t really have a clue. 
		In my professional opinion ,clients who opt to have weight loss surgery should be encouraged to rethink their eating habits and their diet because good nutrients and healthy eating make up 80% of achieving optimum results to maintain the “ perfect body and skin ”. When my clients ask  for my advice about a diet programme, I  refer them to the Arbonne 30 day healthy living programme-a programme that I feel passionate about. I myself have been on the programme and have obtained positive results.
