			<h2>What I Do?</h2>
			<p>My backround is in operating theatre nursing, anaesthetic and recovery.
		  	 Whilst working in the private sector, I developed an interest
				in manual lymphatic drainage.I realised that there was a great need for post-op
				care following cosmetic surgery. I also noticed that MLD enhances the results of surgical procedure.
			 and decided to train as an MLD therapist. 

			 On successful completion of this training I worked for the private clinic in Manchester
			and started my business - RejuvenateMLD.  
		 	 I offer Manual Lymphatic Drainage therapy for Post-Op, Cosmetic patients and Liposuction after care.
