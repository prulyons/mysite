		<h2>What I Do?</h2>
		<p>I am currently working as an anaesthetic and recovery nurse.
		   Whilst working in the private sector,I realised that there was a great need for post-op care in cosmetic surgery. I also noticed that MLD enhances the results of surgical procedure. I developed a keen interest in Manual lymphatic drainage and decided to train as an MLD therapist. 

		   On successful completion of this training I worked for the private clinic in Manchester. I also started my business - RejuvinateMLD.  
		   I offer Manual Lymphatic Drainage therapy for Post-Op, Cosmetic patients and Liposuction after care.
